Basic SDL2 Image Viewer.

Supports opening an image and iterating through images in a directory.

Still needs a lot of improvement, but it's functional.

## Installation:

```
git clone (this repo)
make
```

## Usage:
`./(program) (arg1)`

Will eventually make it so an argument is not necessary, in which case, it will display images in the current directory.
